Description: ## About
        Python script to upload videos on YouTube using Selenium
        that allows to upload more than 6<sup>1</sup> videos per day 
        which is the maximum [[1]](https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload/issues/268) for all other tools that use the [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3).
        
        ###### <sup>1</sup>: Since the projects that enable the YouTube Data API have a default quota allocation of `10,000` units per day [[2]](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#calculating-quota-usage) and a video upload has a cost of approximately `1,600` units [[3]](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota): `10,000 / 1,600 = 6.25`.
        
        Instead, this script is only restricted by a daily upload limit for a channel on YouTube:
        > 100 videos is the limit in the first 24 hours, then drops to 50 every 24 hours after that. [[4]](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/1187675?hl=en)
        
        ## Package Installation
        ```bash
        pip3 install --upgrade youtube-uploader-selenium
        ```
        
        ## Script Installation
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/linouk23/youtube-uploader-selenium
        cd youtube-uploader-selenium
        ```
        
        ## Package Usage
        ```python
        from youtube_uploader_selenium import YouTubeUploader
        
        video_path = '123/rockets.flv'
        metadata_path = '123/rockets_metadata.json'
        
        uploader = YouTubeUploader(video_path, metadata_path)
        was_video_uploaded, video_id = uploader.upload()
        assert was_video_uploaded
        ```
        
        ## Script Usage
        At a minimum, just specify a video:
        
        ```bash
        python3 upload.py --video rockets.flv
        ```
        
        If it is the first time you've run the script, a browser window should popup and prompt you to provide YouTube credentials (and then simply press <it>Enter</it> after a successful login).
        A token will be created and stored in a file in the local directory for subsequent use.
        
        Video title, description and other metadata can specified via a JSON file using the `--meta` flag:
        ```bash
        python3 upload.py --video rockets.flv --meta metadata.json
        ```
        
        An example JSON file would be:
        ```json
        {
          "title": "Best Of James Harden | 2019-20 NBA Season",
          "description": "Check out the best of James Harden's 2019-20 season so far!"
        }
        ```
